✨ **SetupFiles** ✨

**Overview**

This repository contains the configuration files for my personal development environment on MacOS, which leverages **Warp.dev** and **Neovim** as core components. These dotfiles are the culmination of continuous iteration and optimization in pursuit of an efficient and seamless development experience.

**Key Considerations**

1.	Cloud-Synced Tools Exclusion:
   
Configurations for tools that support native cloud synchronization (e.g., Microsoft Edge, Visual Studio Code) are not included in this repository. These tools maintain their own mechanisms for syncing settings across devices.

2.	Dynamic and Iterative Development
   
The configurations here are updated regularly to accommodate evolving needs and newly discovered optimizations. This repository represents an ongoing journey of refinement, rather than a static solution.

**Documentation**

Documentation for custom keybindings, scripts, and configuration logic will be available in the docs/ directory. Refer to this documentation to understand the implementation details and to adapt the configuration for your own use.

Feel free to explore, adapt, or draw inspiration from these configurations as you craft your own development environment. Contributions and feedback are always welcome!
